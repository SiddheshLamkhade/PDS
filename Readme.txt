                                 **---------üõí E-Ratio Details----------**

The **Public Distribution System (PDS)** in India provides subsidized food grains through **Fair Price Shops (FPS)** 
but suffers from inefficiencies, manual processes, and corruption.  

The proposed **e-Ration Shop** is a digital platform allowing ration card holders to order items online,
ensuring transparency, efficiency, and a user-friendly experience.  


It is modern, secure, and intelligent Public Distribution System
(PDS) for India that not only handles the distribution of ration to citizens, but also predicts
and manages stock intelligently using time-series forecasting.

---------------------------------------

The current PDS is plagued by:  
- Urban bias  
- Fake ration cards  
- Malpractice by FPS dealers  

Beneficiaries often receive less than their entitled share, and there is little recourse for complaints.  
Due to lack of automation and monitoring, corruption and diversion of food grains are common.  
A **digital solution** is needed to ensure fair and accountable distribution.  

---

### Objectives of the e-Ration Platform
- Enable ration card holders to order groceries online  
- Prevent corruption and reduce manual errors  
- Provide real-time stock visibility and transparency  
- Ensure rightful entitlements reach beneficiaries  
- Empower users with grievance redressal tools  

---

The **e-Ration Shop** aims to transform PDS by ensuring **fair, transparent,
and digital access** to essential goods.  
It reduces corruption, improves user access, and supports government goals under **Digital India**.  
This system can play a vital role in making **food security more reliable and citizen-focused**.

##  We‚Äôll create a web-based platform with different portals for different users:

**1. Citizen Portal ‚Äî** 
where beneficiaries can register, check their quotas, see distribution history, and download receipts.

**2. Dealer Portal ‚Äî** 
where ration shop owners can manage stock, distribute items, and request replenishment.

**3. Admin Portal ‚Äî** 
where the government admin can monitor the whole network, track 
stock, approve reorders, and use Smart Inventory Forecasting to anticipate shortages before they happen.
